      Have you ever stopped to wonder what truly drives innovation? It’s not just intelligence, or resources, or even timing—it’s <em>curiosity</em>.<br>
       That deep, relentless urge to ask why, and then ask what if. <br>
       Some of the greatest breakthroughs in history began with a simple question. <br>
       The lightbulb wasn’t invented by someone trying to make a bulb—it was made by someone trying to light up the world.<br>
       And in that same spirit, every one of us holds the power to spark change. <br>
      Not by being perfect, but by being curious, by being bold enough to imagine a different future—and then brave enough to build it.<br>
