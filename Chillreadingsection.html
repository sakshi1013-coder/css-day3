     Have you ever stopped to wonder what truly drives innovation? Itâ€™s not just intelligence, or resources, or even timingâ€”itâ€™s curiosity.<br>
     That deep, relentless urge to ask why, and then ask what if. <br>
     Some of the greatest breakthroughs in history began with a simple question. <br>
     The lightbulb wasnâ€™t invented by someone trying to make a bulbâ€”it was made by someone trying to light up the world. <br>
     And in that same spirit, every one of us holds the power to spark change.<br>
     Not by being perfect, but by being curious, by being bold enough to imagine a different futureâ€”and then brave enough to build it.<br>
     **What to do:**
<ul>
<li>- Use Arial to keep it readable.</li>
<li>- Font size? Let's say 1.2em.</li>
<li>- Line height? 1.6 for smooth reading.</li>
<li>- Add `margin: 20px` so it's not stuck to the edge.</li>
</ul>

ðŸ§  *Tip:* Imagine someone sipping coffee and reading your text.
